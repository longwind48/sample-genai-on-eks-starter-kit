![John's Application Ready for Processing](/static/images/module-3/example1.png) 

*John's application is waiting - let's process it with AI!*

## ✅ Prerequisites Check

Before we deploy, let's make sure your GenAI platform from Modules 1 & 2 is ready:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Check your platform components are running
kubectl get pods -n litellm
kubectl get pods -n langfuse

# Verify LiteLLM gateway is accessible
echo "LiteLLM URL: http://$(kubectl get ingress -n litellm litellm -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"

# Check Langfuse observability
echo "Langfuse URL: http://$(kubectl get ingress -n langfuse langfuse -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"
:::

::alert[**Platform Required**: All pods should show "Running" status. If any components are missing, please complete Modules 1 & 2 first.]{type="warning"}

## 🔧 Step 1: Understanding the Configuration

Before we deploy, let's understand what Loan Buddy needs to connect to your GenAI platform:

### Required Configuration

1. **🪣 S3 Bucket** - Where to store uploaded loan documents
   - Automatically created by Terraform when Langfuse was deployed
   - Retrieved from: `terraform output langfuse_bucket_name`

2. **🌍 AWS Region** - Where your resources are located
   - Configured in your `.env` file as `REGION`
   - Used for S3 and other AWS service calls

3. **🔑 LiteLLM API Key** - Your Virtual Key from Module 2
   - Allows the agent to call LLM models through the gateway
   - You created this in Module 2, Step 9

4. **📊 Langfuse Credentials** - For observability and tracing
   - Public and secret keys from your `.env` file
   - Enables complete audit trails of AI decisions

5. **🔐 Service Account with S3 Access** - Kubernetes RBAC + AWS IAM
   - Copies the Langfuse service account to workshop namespace
   - Creates Pod Identity Association for S3 permissions
   - Allows pods to securely access S3 without hardcoded credentials

### Verify Your Credentials

First, let's make sure you have your Virtual Key from Module 2:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Check if you have your AGENT_KEY from Module 2
if [ -z "$AGENT_KEY" ]; then
  echo "❌ AGENT_KEY not found. Please set it from Module 2"
  echo "Run: export AGENT_KEY='your-sk-key-from-module-2'"
else
  echo "✅ AGENT_KEY found: ${AGENT_KEY:0:10}..."
fi
:::

::alert[**Missing AGENT_KEY?** Go back to Module 2, Step 3 of the Virtual Key section and copy your key. Then run: `export AGENT_KEY="sk-your-actual-key"`]{type="warning"}

## 🎯 Step 2: Automated Deployment

### Run the Deployment Script

We've created an automated deployment script that handles all the configuration for you:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Navigate to the credit validation directory
cd /workshop/workshops/eks-genai-workshop/static/code/module3/credit-validation

# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy-workshop-app.sh

# Run the deployment script
./deploy-workshop-app.sh
:::

### What the Script Does

The script automates the following steps:

1. ✅ **Validates Prerequisites** - Checks kubectl and cluster connectivity
2. ✅ **Retrieves S3 Bucket** - Gets bucket name from Terraform output
3. ✅ **Gets AWS Region** - Loads from .env file
4. ✅ **Configures Credentials** - Sets up LiteLLM and Langfuse keys
5. ✅ **Creates Workshop Namespace** - Isolated environment for the application
6. ✅ **Sets Up Service Account** - Copies Langfuse SA with S3 permissions
7. ✅ **Creates Pod Identity Association** - Grants S3 access to workshop pods
8. ✅ **Configures Deployment** - Replaces all placeholders in YAML
9. ✅ **Deploys Application** - Applies the configured Kubernetes manifests
10. ✅ **Waits for Ready** - Ensures all pods are running

::alert[**Learning Opportunity**: The script creates a file called `agentic-application-deployment.configured.yaml` with all values filled in. Review it to see how the configuration works!]{type="info"}

::::expand{header="🔍 Under the Hood: What's Being Automated"}

**Without the script, you would need to:**

1. **Get S3 Bucket Name:**
   ```bash
   cd /workshop/components/o11y/langfuse
   terraform output langfuse_bucket_name
   ```

2. **Get AWS Region:**
   ```bash
   source /workshop/.env
   echo $REGION
   ```

3. **Manually Edit YAML File:**
   - Replace `<>` with S3 bucket name (2 places)
   - Replace `<>` with AWS region (2 places)
   - Replace Langfuse keys (2 places)
   - Replace LiteLLM keys (2 places)

4. **Create Service Account:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get serviceaccount langfuse -n langfuse -o yaml | \
     sed 's/namespace: langfuse/namespace: workshop/' | \
     kubectl apply -f -
   ```

5. **Create Pod Identity Association:**
   ```bash
   aws eks create-pod-identity-association \
     --cluster-name genai-on-eks \
     --namespace workshop \
     --service-account langfuse \
     --role-arn <IAM_ROLE_ARN>
   ```

6. **Deploy Application:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f agentic-application-deployment.yaml
   ```

**The script does all of this in one command!** This is the same automation pattern used in production CI/CD pipelines.

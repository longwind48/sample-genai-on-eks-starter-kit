weight: 2
---

Remember all those conversations you had with vLLM and Bedrock models? Langfuse has been quietly tracking every single interaction - capturing prompts, responses, performance metrics, and costs. Let's explore the treasure trove of data it's collected about your AI usage!

## 🛠️ Hands-On: See Your AI Interactions Tracked

Let's discover what Langfuse has been learning about your AI usage:

### Step 1: Explore Your Observability Stack

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# See the complete observability stack
kubectl get all -n langfuse
:::

You should see a comprehensive observability platform:
- **langfuse-clickhouse-0**: Analytics database for performance data
- **langfuse-postgresql-0**: Database for trace metadata
- **langfuse-redis-master-0**: Caching layer
- **langfuse-s3-xxx**: Object storage for large data
- **langfuse-web-xxx**: Main Langfuse application

### Step 2: Explore the Real Configuration

In your VSC IDE, let's examine the actual configuration:

:::code{language=bash showCopyAction=true}
# Look at the actual Langfuse Helm values
cat /workshop/components/o11y/langfuse/values.template.yaml

# See the complete stack configuration
grep -A 5 "postgresql:\|clickhouse:\|redis:" /workshop/components/o11y/langfuse/values.template.yaml
:::

Notice how Langfuse is pre-configured with your project settings and automatically initialized!

## What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an open-source LLM observability platform that provides:

- 📊 **Comprehensive Tracing**: Every LLM interaction captured with full context
- 💰 **Cost Tracking**: Token usage and costs across all models
- ⚡ **Performance Analytics**: Latency, throughput, and quality metrics
- 🔍 **Debugging Tools**: Detailed request/response inspection
- 📈 **Usage Analytics**: Patterns, trends, and optimization insights
- 🏗️ **Multi-Database Architecture**: PostgreSQL + ClickHouse + Redis for scale

## How Langfuse is Deployed

Our Langfuse deployment uses the [official Langfuse Helm Chart](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/deployment/kubernetes-helm) with a comprehensive observability stack. The full values.template.yaml file can be found at `/workshop/components/o11y/langfuse/values.template.yaml`. Here's how each section of the Helm configuration works:

:::::tabs

::::tab{label="Resources & Architecture"}
**Main Application Resources**

Langfuse requires adequate resources for processing and analyzing LLM traces:

:::code{language=yaml showCopyAction=true}
langfuse:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1 
      memory: 2Gi
    limits:
      memory: 2Gi
:::

**Multi-Database Architecture**

Langfuse uses a sophisticated multi-database setup for optimal performance:

:::code{language=yaml showCopyAction=true}
postgresql:  # Metadata and user data
  auth:
    username: admin
    password: password123
  primary:
    resources: 
      requests:
        cpu: 125m
        memory: 256Mi

clickhouse:  # Analytics and time-series data
  auth:
    password: password123
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 1    
      memory: 3Gi

redis:  # Caching and sessions
  auth:
    password: password123
  primary:
    resources: 
      requests:
        cpu: 125m
        memory: 256Mi

s3:  # Object storage for large traces
  auth:
    rootPassword: password123
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 250m    
      memory: 256Mi
:::

**Why This Architecture:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Fast queries for recent traces and user management
- **ClickHouse**: Optimized for analytics and large-scale aggregations
- **Redis**: High-speed caching for UI responsiveness
- **S3**: Cost-effective storage for historical trace data
::::

::::tab{label="Authentication & Initialization"}
**Automatic Project Setup**

Langfuse is pre-configured with your workshop project and user account:

:::code{language=yaml showCopyAction=true}
langfuse:
  additionalEnv:

::::

::::tab{label="Networking & Ingress"}
**Load Balancer Configuration**

Langfuse uses AWS Application Load Balancer for external access:

:::code{language=yaml showCopyAction=true}
langfuse:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
      {{#if DOMAIN}}

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant OpenWebUI
    participant LiteLLM
    participant Model
    participant Langfuse
    
    User->>OpenWebUI: Send message
    OpenWebUI->>LiteLLM: API request
    LiteLLM->>Model: Route to model
    LiteLLM->>Langfuse: Start trace
    Model-->>LiteLLM: Response
    LiteLLM->>Langfuse: Complete trace with metrics
    LiteLLM-->>OpenWebUI: Response
    OpenWebUI-->>User: Display response
    
    Note over Langfuse: Stores: prompt, response,<br/>tokens, cost, latency
```


## Key Insights You Can Discover

✅ **Model Performance**: Compare response times between your models

✅ **Cost Analysis**: See exactly how much each interaction cost

✅ **Usage Patterns**: Understand your AI interaction habits

✅ **Quality Tracking**: Identify which models gave better responses

✅ **Token Efficiency**: See which prompts were most effective


## What's Next?

Now that you've explored both LiteLLM (your API gateway) and Langfuse (your observability platform), you have a complete GenAI platform running on EKS! 

In the next module, we'll use this platform foundation to build sophisticated AI applications with agents, memory, and advanced reasoning capabilities.

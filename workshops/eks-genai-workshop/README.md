# Architect and deploy advanced Agentic AI platforms on Amazon EKS

An 8-hour intermediate-level AWS Workshop Studio project that teaches engineers how to build production-ready Generative AI platforms on Amazon EKS.

## Overview

This workshop provides comprehensive guidance on deploying and scaling Generative AI applications using Kubernetes on Amazon EKS. Through hands-on labs and progressive modules, participants learn to optimize LLMs, build scalable platform components, and create intelligent agentic applications.

## Workshop Structure

### Module 1: LLM Optimization
- Optimize open-source LLMs using LeaderWorkerSet (LWS) pattern
- Implement tensor parallelism, quantization, and KV-cache optimization
- Build evaluation frameworks for model performance

### Module 2: GenAI Platform Components
- Design scalable platform architecture on Amazon EKS
- Implement AI gateways with LiteLLM for unified API access
- Set up observability with LangFuse and LangSmith
- Configure network observability and monitoring

### Module 3: Agentic Applications
- Build intelligent applications using LangChain/LangGraph
- Integrate vector databases for persistent memory
- Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration
- Create multi-agent systems and agentic RAG applications

### Module 4: Scaling & Security
- Implement distributed inference patterns
- Configure production-ready security with Pod Identity and ACK controllers
- Optimize costs and resource utilization
- Deploy at scale with proper monitoring
